## About Speed The Tuning Car (Tuning Car Rental Application)

This is a Java project I created in 2020 as part of my studies. A desktop application to help a cars rental company to manage their rentals.
Stored in a database are the types of clients and cars that can be rented. The duration can be specified for how many days the client wants to rent the car.
You can add a new client and delete it from the database.

## Steps to get started 

- Clone the repository
- Initialize your MySQL database by executing the file: /SQL_File/Database.sql
- Update database connection: /src/model/DBConnection.java
- Compile and run the application with ECLIPSE IDE or similar IDE.
